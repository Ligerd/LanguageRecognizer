English is an international means of communication.
It is studied as a foreign language at secondary and higher schools of our country.

As for me I like English very much.
I studied English at school and Iâ€™m studying it now.
I study it every day because I want to have a good command of the language.
I am sure if I work at it systematically as I do now I will know the language very well.
I try to do my best to master English as quickly as possible.
I study pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar.
I try to speak English with my teachers and with my friends.
I read much and do many language exercise.
I have many English books.
I know that foreign languages are of great importance in our modern life.
